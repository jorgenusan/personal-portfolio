            <p>
                I am a machine learning developer, focused on computer vision,
                with great interest in other branches such as pure backend and
                frontend development. <br />I work mainly on the generation of
                deep learning models and the development of applications for the
                integration and production of these models, especially in object
                detection and classification applications.{" "}
